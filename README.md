# Altmetrics sandbox
A place to experiment with altmetrics tools and code.

## Requirements
Most of the code will be contained in [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/install.html). If you're using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable) to manage your Python environments be sure to check out [this post](http://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/IPythonNotebookVirtualenvs) to use the virtualenvironments in Jupyter notebooks.

Install the required Python modules using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Configuration file
Copy `config.cnf` and create a `local_config.cnf` with your actual API keys.

## Executing the notebooks
Clone this repo and fire up your notebook with `jupyter notebook` and you're ready to go.
